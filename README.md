# DSA Stepâ€‘byâ€‘Step

A handsâ€‘on C++ repository for learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) gradually through dayâ€‘wise practice problems and pattern exercises.

---

## ðŸ§© Overview

This repository is organized by **days**, each day containing a set of small C++ programs to build up fundamentals. Youâ€™ll find:

- Basic arithmetic & control flow  
- Looping & conditional logic  
- Patterns (star, number, character, pyramid etc.)  
- Use of functions  
- And more as you expand

Each folder under `Day_N` contains subfolders (e.g. `P1`, `P2`, etc.) representing individual problems, each containing a `.cpp` source and sometimes an executable (`a.exe`).
